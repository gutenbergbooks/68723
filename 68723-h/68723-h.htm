<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>I have written this account of my experience
in the service of my country from memory,
aided by old diaries, letters, etc., and have endeavored
to be as accurate as possible, in regard
to dates and events of historical importance, but
if mistakes occur, it cannot be wondered at, after
such a lapse of time. Some of my diaries were
lost upon the battlefield, and of those that remain,
many of the entries were in pencil and are
almost effaced.</p>

<p>I had no intention when I began writing
of making a long story, but as I went on, memory
brought back many a stirring scene, many a
weary march, many a tender thought of comrades
who shared them all with me, and so I have written
them down as they came to me.</p>

<p>My thanks are due my wife for so carefully
editing, and my son for printing my attempt
to keep in a permanent form, my recollections of
the War of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>I have often been asked to narrate my experience
in the War of the Rebellion, and have
as often refused, but now after the lapse of thirty
three years since the close of that fearful
struggle between brother men, I feel that perhaps
it would be well, for the satisfaction of those who
so earnestly desire it, to “Fight my battles over
again.”</p>

<p>Mine was not an exceptional experience,
only that of many a boy of ’61, but it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
partly answer the question so often asked: “What
did the privates do?”</p>

<p>I have often wondered how it happened
that I, born of quaker stock on my mother’s side
(she was descended from the Kemptons, who
were among the first settlers of our quaker city
of New Bedford,) should have had such a natural
leaning towards scenes of adventure and conflict.
It may well have been that I inherited it from
the paternal side of the house, for my father’s
father, John James, was taken prisoner on board
his ship during the War of 1812, and thrown into
an English prison, and I have often, during
my childhood, listened to his tales of warfare and
bloodshed, and longed to be a man that I might
fight and avenge the wrongs inflicted on my devoted
country in its earlier days; and how I
wished, as I read of the War of the Revolution,
that I might have lived in those stirring days, and
done my part in creating the American Nation.</p>

<p>Certainly it did not seem possible that
occasion would ever arise when I should be one
of the defenders of that great nation.</p>

<p>The attack on Fort Sumter, the shot
that so stirred the loyal hearts of the men of the
North, awakened in me an ardent desire to enlist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
and help avenge the insult to our country’s flag,
but my father was so opposed to the idea that I
reluctantly yielded to his authority until a few
months later, during a visit to my brother in
Woburn, Mass., I enlisted November 2nd 1861,
just past my twentieth birthday, in Co. B, 1st
Battalion, afterwards the 32nd Mass. Infantry.
The company was raised by George L. Prescott,
of Concord, Mass.</p>

<p>We were mustered into the United States
service on November 27th, and on December 3rd
were sent to Fort Warren, Boston harbor, to
guard prisoners of war, among them being the
confederate generals Buckner and Tilghman,
Commodore Barron, Colonel Pegram, the confederate
commissioners Mason and Slidell, the
mayor and chief of police of Baltimore, and
many others.</p>

<p>I remember an incident that may be of
interest to which I was an eye-witness:
General Buckner was walking on the parapet,
under guard, when a foreign man of war was being
saluted in accordance with military usage;
a large 32 lb. gun was belching forth half minute
salutes; as he drew near it, wrapped in deep
thought, not seeming to notice what was taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
place the order came to fire just as he was abreast
of the gun; he realized his danger and jumped forward
just in time, for the next instant the gun was
discharged, and the prisoner must have felt that
it was indeed a narrow escape.</p>

<p>Many other interesting incidents connected
with these celebrated prisoners occur to me,
but they would make my story too long.</p>

<p>We were drilled in the art of war during
all that winter, and under the strictest military
discipline, the commander of the fort being that
brave old martinet of the regular army, Colonel
Justin E. Dimmock. My brother George also
enlisted in the same company as myself and was
with me at Fort Warren, but the hardships and
exposures of that long cold winter and an attack
of typhoid fever undermined his health to such
an extent that he was discharged a short time
before we left Fort Warren for the seat of war
in the following May.</p>

<p>The hard and laborious life of the army
seemed to agree with me, and from the day of my
enlistment until the time I was wounded, more
than three years later, my health was perfect,
which was something to be thankful for, in the
army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>I did not regret leaving my brother behind
me for I felt that one son was enough for
my father to spare for his country’s service; besides
my brother had a wife and child, while I
was young, with no mother to mourn for me,
should I fall, and I felt that I could be spared
better than those who had home ties, and that I
could face hardships and dangers better than
those who had families depending upon them.
In short it seemed my duty and pleasure to go to
the war.</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Unknown.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the 25th of May we left Fort Warren
for the seat of war. Arriving at Washington we
went into camp Alexander. June 30th our battalion,
now composed of six companies, was ordered
to join the army on the peninsula. Embarking
on the transport Hero we arrived at
Fortress Munroe July 2nd.</p>

<p>We continued on up the James river,
landing at what was formerly President Harrison’s
plantation, on July 4th 1862. Now began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
our soldier life in earnest, for fighting was then
going on; mud was knee deep and all was confusion.
We were assigned to the brigade of Gen.
Charles Griffin, division of Gen. Morell, in Fitz
John Porter’s command, afterwards the Fifth
Army Corps.</p>

<p>We were drawn up in line and given 80
rounds of ammunition. Just then an officer rode
up covered with mud, and said: “Well boys, I
will give you a chance at the rebs; keep cool and
fire low!” Off he went, and I was informed it
was Gen. George B. McClellan.</p>

<p>We moved through a piece of woods, and
were opened upon by a battery. It was getting to
be pretty warm, when the order came “Forward to
charge the battery,” but before we could move, the
order was countermanded, and we retreated; this
was the end of the Seven Days Fight.</p>

<p>We camped upon the banks of the river
and staid there six weeks, every day sickness and
death reducing our ranks, for it was a very unhealthy
place. In fact it was the worst place
that could be imagined for a camp, marshy, wet
ground, dust and mud alternating; what wonder
is it that our men sickened and died? Here on
August 9th Lieut. Nathaniel French Jr., one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the most promising officers in our regiment died
of malarial fever.</p>

<p>Through it all my health remained perfect,
and I was always ready for duty. Many
of our regiment were here detailed to act as
guards over the quartermaster’s stores on the river
bank.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival at Harrison’s Landing,
President Lincoln visited and reviewed our
army. Our division stood in line from four
o’clock in the afternoon until after nine in the
evening, and then a party rode by in the moonlight,
one of whom was said to be the President
of the United States; as he was the only one who
wore a stove-pipe hat, we concluded that it must
be a fact, that we had been duly reviewed, and
gladly broke ranks and prepared our suppers.</p>

<p>On the night of August 1st the enemy
ran six pieces of artillery down on the opposite
side of the James river, and about midnight
opened upon our camp, and cold iron rained upon
us, ending our slumbers for that night. We had
two tents for the officers, and five for the men,
and solid shot went through them all, but we escaped
serious injury, which seemed rather remarkable.
We were more than eager to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
this sickly camp and life of inaction, but here we
had to stay and wait for marching orders.</p>

ON THE MARCH.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And we marched away to join the fray,</div>
<div class="indent">Where the work of death was done,</div>
<div class="verse">And soon we stood where the battle clouds</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">’Mid the battle’s din our ranks grew thin,</div>
<div class="indent">And we dug our comrades’ graves,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Benj. Russell Jr.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Marching orders came on August 10th,
and we gladly took up our line of march, passing
through Williamsburg, Yorktown and Big Bethel
to Newport News, where we boarded steamer
Belvidere for Acquia Creek, thence by rail to
Stafford Courthouse, near Fredericksburg. We
were still kept on the move, and on August 27th
we marched out on the Gainesville road, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
formed in line of battle; here we had quite a
sharp brush with the enemy. We were endeavoring
to head him off in his march northward,
but were too late, and had to chase him as rapidly
as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i019.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">March 6, 1865.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the long and weary
march of the next day, which happened to be my
twenty-first birthday. All that hot, dusty day
was spent in a forced march, and we suffered
greatly for water, of which there was none to be
had in that dreary country. Along in the afternoon
I came to a puddle of water covered with
green slime, in which partly lay a dead mule, who
had probably died while trying to slake his
thirst. I did not take warning by him, but
brushed aside the green scum and took a drink;
it was wet and that was all that could be said of
it.</p>

<p>I dragged myself along until within an
hour of sunset, and then I dropped by the roadside
as hundreds had done before me. Our surgeon
came along, and kindly urged me to keep
on, saying we were to camp in a piece of woods
about a mile further on; but I was too far gone
to stir then. I rested an hour or so, and then
limped into camp; too weary to get anything to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
eat or drink, I took off my equipments and without
even unrolling my blanket, dropped upon the
ground, and with my knapsack for a pillow, slept
all night the dreamless sleep of a tired soldier.</p>

<p>When the boys reached camp, their first
thought was to find water; there was but one well
in the vicinity, and that was found under guard
reserved for the headquarters mess. The indignant
rank and file drove off the guard and helped
themselves to the water.</p>

<p>Some of the boys, not knowing of the
well, went into the swamp and dipped up the
stagnant water there. No wonder there was a
large amount of sickness after that time. It did
not make me sick, but I felt rather lame when I
awoke in the morning.</p>

<p>Next day, August 29th, we arrived on the
old battle ground of Bull Run, in time to take
part in the second battle of Bull Run. Again we
had to fall back, and again we took up the line
of march.</p>

<p>The next day we moved at 3 o’clock A. M.
and camped at 11 P. M., after a march of twenty
eight miles. At Chantilla we met the enemy on
September 1st, but after a short engagement again
kept on, marching through Georgetown into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
the state of Maryland. It was hot weather,
and many of the men fell exhausted by the way;
but we must not pause, for the enemy was still
pressing northward and we must get between
him and our own loved homes.</p>

<p>When we reached the South Mountain
battle ground, that fierce conflict was over and
they were burying the dead. I saw the body of
General Reno who was killed in that battle. We
had won a victory, but the loss was very heavy,
and we had lost the gallant Reno, a serious blow
for our cause. The idol of his men, they greatly
mourned his loss.</p>

<p>Harper’s Ferry had fallen, and Lee was
gathering his army on the west bank of Antietam
Creek in Maryland. When we reached the east
side of the creek, we caught up to the main army
under General McClellan on the 16th of September,
just at sunset. We found the rebels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
to be well posted behind the top of the ridge on
the other side of the stream.</p>

<p>The two armies now stood face to face,
for McClellan’s army was camped on the east
side of the hills on the west branch of the Antietam.
Our division was soon among them, and
busy getting our supper, while we could see the
smoke from the campfires of the opposing forces,
where they too were preparing their evening
meal.</p>

<p>What a beautiful sight it was after nightfall!
The thousands of glowing campfires upon
both hillsides made a picture upon my memory
that time will never efface. After our weary
march it seemed good to be here in camp, even
though I knew a battle was to be expected the
next day. I remember how peaceful and quiet
everything seemed, and the cheerfulness of the
men around me, showed how they enjoyed the
welcome rest, and how little they thought of the
conflict before them.</p>

<p>The 17th of September dawned fair and
pleasant, but what a storm of death took place
that day! The battle began at dawn and lasted
until dark. The loss of life was terrible; the loss
to the Union army alone was more than fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
thousand men. We held the field, but on that
narrow strip of ground between the Potomac river
and Antietam Creek lay many thousands of
brave men, while their comrades were so worn
out with their terrible exertions that they could
hardly find strength to care for the wounded or
bury the dead.</p>

<p>Our regiment being on the reserve, supporting
a battery, our loss was not heavy. On
the 18th our corps relieved the ninth (Burnside’s)
corps at the lower bridge. On the 19th we expected
another battle, but the enemy had retreated
during the night. We pursued them through
Sharpsburg, capturing many prisoners and several
pieces of artillery. We went into camp and excepting
a two days raid to Leestown, remained
quiet until October 30th, when we started for
Harper’s Ferry and crossed the river into Virginia
once more.</p>

UNDER ARREST.</h2>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>L. M. James.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>My company was detailed to guard the
ammunition train on its way back into Virginia.
Before starting on the march, we had general
orders read to us, forbidding all foraging in
Maryland. On the first day’s march towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Harper’s Ferry, several of the boys, myself included,
noticed a number of small pigs in a field
near the road.</p>

<p>As we had been on very short rations for
about a week, it seemed to us a good chance to
have a feast when we went into camp, so over
the fence after the pigs we went. As I raised
my gun to fire at a pig, I saw General Griffin,
(who commanded our brigade,) and his staff, passing
along the road on the further side of the
wagons.</p>

<p>I waited until I thought he was beyond
the sound of my rifle and then fired. The bullet
passed through the pig, struck a stone, glanced,
and went down the road, passing within a foot
of the general’s head, for he had stopped for a
few moments, instead of riding on as I had supposed.</p>

<p>After I had shot the pig, one of the boys
ran up and was using the butt of his gun to finish
him and stop his squealing, when suddenly we
were surrounded by the staff of Gen. Griffin! I
made a break for the road, but found it was of
no use, for the general himself stood by the fence,
so back I went and with the rest of the boys was
placed under arrest. Orders were given to march<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
us to camp without rest, and carry the pig along,
which we took turns in doing. It was a long
pull, and when I could march no longer, down I
sat. The guard repeated the order. “I am going
to rest,” I said. “Don’t let the general see
you,” said the guard.</p>

<p>I did not rest long, but traveled all day
without anything to eat, for we had left our haversacks
and overcoats in the teams, which were
now a long distance ahead.</p>

<p>At night we went into camp, then had to
dress the pig, and it was cooked for the supper
of the general and his staff, and we poor fellows
got nothing. We pitched the general’s tent and
were then turned over to the provost guard.
About eight o’clock I went under guard to the
general’s tent to do something he wanted done.
“Guard, to your quarters,” said the general, “This
man will not run away!” “No, general, I will
not,” said I, and I quickly performed the duty
required of me and went back to the provost
guard.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock we were all sent under
guard to our regimental headquarters. Our colonel
had just rolled himself up in his blanket for
the night and did not care to be disturbed. “Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
you know where your company is?” he demanded:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yes sir” we answered, without any regard
for facts.</p>

<p>“Go to it,” he ordered, and we gladly started,
free men once more. There were one hundred
thousand men in the camp, and to find one small
company in the middle of the night was no easy
task, but about daylight we found the teams and
our haversacks, got something to eat, and started
off on the march again. So ended the only time
in my life that I was a prisoner, or under arrest.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac, on November
10th, 1862, was massed near Warrington Virginia,
where General McClellan was relieved from
command of the army. I shall never forget the
grief that was manifested by the soldiers on the
removal of this popular commander. Ever mindful
of the welfare and comfort of his men, he
had won a warm place in their hearts, and enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>He was succeeded by General Burnside,
and after a week of rest, we started for Falmouth
Virginia, and on the 22nd went into camp at
Stoneman’s Switch. Here we remained most of
the time all winter, although we expected every
day to be ordered off on the march again for the
unknown “Somewhere.”</p>

<p>I well remember the hungry Thanksgiving
day spent here. We were a long ways from
our base of supplies at Acquia Creek, and all
that we received was brought in wagons for several
miles over hard and rough roads from Belle
Plain.</p>

<p>For a week we lived on hardtack, and
the morning of Thanksgiving day, we received
the last of the supplies in our regiment, half a
cracker for each man. This was all we had until
afternoon; our officers were out all the morning
hunting in every direction for food, and at last
succeeded in borrowing twenty boxes of hard bread,
which was all that the officers and men
had that day.</p>

<p>How we thought of home that day and
the good dinners that we had enjoyed on former
festival days! How little our friends at home
would have enjoyed their feast, could they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
known that we were starving! In the course of
the day I happened to see, near the tent where
the officers bought their supplies, (for they did
not draw rations like the rank and file,) a few
beans that had been trodden down into the mud.
I carefully picked them out, and perhaps got half
a pint altogether, which I washed and stewed,
and with my tentmate, made out our Thanksgiving
dinner.</p>

<p>This was not the only time I have gone
hungry; many a time have I suffered from hunger
from cold, and from heat, but I shall ever remember
that particular time, for it seemed to
make me still more hungry as I thought of former
Thanksgiving feasts, and the food I had
wasted. But such are the fortunes of war, and
we bore it as we did all other discomforts, as
part of the price that must be paid, that our flag
might again wave over an undivided country.</p>

<p>Here we remained for some weeks, building
ourselves log shanties, chopping wood, standing
guard, being drilled, inspected, reviewed, and
now and then going over towards the river and
watching the confederates making their works
good and strong, against the time when we were
ready to attack them. While we were making
ready, they were building and strengthening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
works, that would be beyond the power of mortal
man to carry by assault, and yet that was
what we were called upon to do, when at last
General Burnside had got his army ready for active
service. He had entirely re-organized the
Army of the Potomac, which now numbered
one hundred and twenty thousand men, divided
into three grand divisions, each division consisting
of two corps. Everything possible was done
to strengthen our forces, and put us in good condition
for active service; all this was not completed
until the 11th of September.</p>

<p>The town of Fredericksburg is on the
south side of the Rappahannock river, nearly opposite
Falmouth. Back of the town is the range
of hills called Marye’s Heights, where Lee’s army
was strongly entrenched, when Gen. Burnside
had got ready for business.</p>

<p>General Lee, with his three hundred cannon,
covered the town and river, and his position
was one of the strongest, yet Burnside persisted
in his plan of attack, for on the morning of the
11th of December, at daybreak, the bugle sounded
“Forward!”</p>

<p>It was a still, cold morning, and we started
off in heavy marching order, our regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
leading, as it was our turn that day. We were
in good spirits, although we knew that we had
started out on a desperate attempt, and were enroute
for Fredericksburg, three miles away. We
marched to a point near the river and remained
until the next day, when we crossed the river on
pontoon bridges under a heavy fire from the enemy,
with terrible loss of life.</p>

<p>On the 13th the bloody battle of Fredericksburg
was begun, one of the most disastrous
of the war. It was a useless, ill-judged endeavor
to rout Lee’s army from his impregnable position.
In this battle more than thirteen thousand men
were lost to the Union army, while the confederates
lost less than half that number. My regiment
lost thirty live men, killed and wounded.
Defeated and disheartened, on the morning of the
16th, our army re-crossed the river and returned
to our old camp.</p>

<p>On the 21st of January, 1863, we started
on the “Mud march,” about four o’clock in the
morning. A bitter cold wind was blowing
fiercely, and the air was full of sleet and rain.
We marched all day and when we stopped for
the night, made fires and sat around them all
night to keep warm. The next day was warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
as summer, but rainy; the mud grew deeper, as
we struggled along, sinking in and being pulled
out, taking us all day to go three miles. The
whole country was under water, and you could
not step without sinking above your shoes in
mud. When we stopped for the night we could
only lay down in the mud, or sit by the fires we
managed, with much difficulty, to make.</p>

<p>The next day the water dried up a little,
so we pulled down the fences and used the rails
to corduroy the road. We returned to Stoneman’s
Switch, and re-constructed our shanties as
well as we could, though we sadly missed the
comforts we had destroyed before starting out,
lest, in our absence, they might fall into the
hands of the Johnnies.</p>

<p>We remained in camp until spring, and
before that time arrived. Gen. Burnside was relieved,
and General Hooker took his place. We
gladly heard the order read that relieved him and
appointed “Fighting Joe” as his successor.</p>

<p>On April 27th 1863, we again started on
our tour through Virginia. We crossed the Rappahannock
at Kelley’s Ford, marched to the Rapidan
river, and went into camp on the south side.
A brief rest, and again on the march, arriving at
Chancellorsville, where we waged battle with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
enemy from April 30th to May 5th. Here, on
the 2nd of May, occurred the famous charge of
the eighth Pennsylvania cavalry, numbering but
three hundred men under Major Keenan, on
Stonewall Jackson’s leading division, keeping
them back for a short time, giving our generals

<p>We were defeated, and obliged to retreat,
our brigade being detailed to cover the retreat of
our army back over the river. We formed a line
of battle, and as each division passed, we fell
back a little nearer the river, still keeping our
line of battle. Finally we were within half a
mile of the river, where the last of our army were
rapidly crossing on pontoon bridges. General
Griffin, our brigade commander, had crossed the
river on some duty assigned him, when he was
informed that a large force of the enemy was
rapidly approaching, and his brigade would inevitably
be taken prisoners.</p>

<p>“If they are, I will be taken with them!”
exclaimed our brave commander, and spurring
his horse, he rapidly crossed on the pontoons, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
soon reached us, and marched us quickly to the
river, just as the confederates approached, intent
on gobbling us up. We cut the fastenings of
the pontoons, and the bridge swung off down the
stream just in time, and we were all safely landed
on the other shore, happy to know that we
had escaped the horrors of a rebel prison, or death
at the hands of the merciless foe.</p>

<p>After the battle of Chancellorsville, the
thirty-second Massachusetts was detailed for
guard duty on the railroad to Acquia Creek. We
remained here but a short time however, for
northward moved the enemy, and we on after
them; at Brandy station on the 9th of June, we
caught up with them, and had a sharp engagement,
but failed to stop the march into Pennsylvania.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Crossing the river towards Culpepper
Courthouse, past Morrisville, on to Manassas,
camping on the old battle ground on the night of
the 16th.</p>

<p>We had a tough march the next day, travelling
more than twenty miles; no water was to
be had, and we suffered greatly with the heat
and dust. Our regiment started in the morning
with two hundred and thirty men, and camped
that night with one hundred and seven, of which
number I was one, and this was doing better than
any other regiment in our division. Hundreds
of men dropped by the roadside, fainting and
dying from exhaustion; four died of sunstroke.
We heard indications of battle all day from the
direction of Aldie, and I suppose this forced
march was thought necessary, but I can truly say
that I much preferred all the horrors of the battlefield
to these terrible long marches, when it
seemed impossible to keep up. To drop out was
to lose sight of your regiment, and perhaps die
uncared for, or be gobbled up by guerrillas, who
were plentiful all through that God forsaken
country.</p>

<p>To be captured by guerrillas was sure
death or imprisonment, which to me seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
worse than death on the field. It was during
this march that I acquired the nickname of
“Mosby,” after the noted guerilla Colonel Mosby,
who was then making his dashing raids through
that region, causing his very name to be a terror
to all the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>I had picked up from the road where it
had been dropped, among other impedimenta by
the rebels we were pursuing, a gray cardigan
jacket, which, being much better than the one I
had worn so long, I had put on, and thrown away
the old one. I wore it into the battle of
Gettysburg a few days later, and had several
narrow escapes from being shot for a rebel by
our own men, on account of its color. As it was
all I had, I had to wear it, for we could draw no
clothing on the march.</p>

<p>Some little time after the Gettysburg
fight, I was on guard at the colonel’s tent, and
he noticed my gray jacket, and enquired why I
wore it, and I told him it was all I had.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I’ll see that you have another, my boy,” said
the colonel, and soon after, my captain provided
me with a new blouse, which I gladly donned,
discarding the gray one, which had but one fault
and that was its color. I could not discard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
nickname however, by which I am best remembered
by some of my old comrades, who will
never forget how I fought the Johnny rebs at
Gettysburg, with a confederate’s jacket on.</p>
</div>

<p>At Aldie occurred the great cavalry fight
under Generals Pleasanton, Gregg and Kilpatrick.
What a splendid sight it was! An event
even in our eventful life to see those brave men
move in battle line, with sabres drawn, steady as
though on dress parade! Through the enemy’s
line they went, dealing death right and left. Not
all of them came back, but those who did, came
with victory perched upon their banners.</p>

<p>Then on we went, across the state of
Maryland, encamping at midnight July 1st at
Hanover, Pennsylvania, after a forced march of
sixteen hours. By this time we were about worn
out with so much marching and fighting, but
there was no rest for us yet; for we had hardly
dropped down for the night, when an aid arrived
with orders to march directly to the aid of the
First corps, which was fighting the whole rebel
army at Gettysburg. So again we took up our
weary line of march, pressing forward as fast as
possible to the aid of our comrades. As we
drew near Gettysburg, word passed down the line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
that General McClellan was again in command
of the army.</p>

<p>How we shouted! How we cheered, and
we moved on with quickened step, believing that
our beloved general would lead us on to battle,
and to victory! It was a false report, perhaps
sent down the line to cheer our hearts and quicken
our lagging feet. It served the purpose, but
it was a sad disappointment, when we learned the
truth.</p>

<p>We arrived on the field of Gettysburg at
nine o’clock A. M., July 2nd, and without rest
were ordered into the front line of battle. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
brigade consisted of the 9th and 32nd Massachusetts,
4th Michigan, and 62nd Pennsylvania. We
had hardly got into line, when the enemy advanced
directly upon us, and for an hour we had
it hot and heavy.</p>

<p>Here our regimental loss was heavy, but
we finally repulsed them, and soon after changed
position to a piece of woods bordering on the
wheatfield. Here a line was engaged in the
wheatfield, and the ground was covered with the
wounded and dead. We advanced and relieved
them, when the enemy charged us with such
overwhelming fury that we were obliged to fall
back.</p>

<p>Here Colonel Jeffers of the 4th Michigan
and a color sergeant of the same regiment were
killed, trying to save their flag, but it was captured,
and a part of the regiment were taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>We could not stand the terrible storm of
leaden hail, and were retreating when our brigade
commander halted us and ordered us to face the
charging enemy. It was a fatal act for many
of the Thirty-second! We fought our way back
inch by inch, union and confederate men inextricably
mingled; so we fought until we gained the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
shelter of the woods. I had lost my regiment,
but saw the Pennsylvania Bucktails fixing bayonets
for another charge, so I stepped into their
ranks to charge with them, when I saw my regimental
colors, with four of the color guard near
by, so joined them and waited for the boys to
rally under the old flag, when we again advanced
into the bloody fray.</p>

<p>I look back with pride upon the valor
shown that day by my brave comrades; at Little
Roundtop, the Wheatfield, in the Loop, many a
brave boy of the 32nd gave up his life, in that
terrible struggle. Our regiment carried into the
fight 227 men, and we lost 81 killed and wounded.
My tentmate, Dwight D. Graves, went
down severely wounded in the foot, and another
comrade, Calvin P. Lawrence, was left on the
field with a broken leg when we fell back. As
the rebs charged over him, one of them turned to
bayonet him, but his lieutenant prevented him,
and asked the wounded man,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where’s your men now?”</p>

<p>“You just keep on, you’ll find them!” was the
reply, as the men swept over him. Soon they
rushed back in full retreat, and our brave comrade
shouted after them, “I say, leftenant, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
guess you found them.” We kept the field, and
all that night I spent looking over the battle
ground for wounded comrades, giving to one a
drink of water from my canteen, placing a knapsack
under the head of another, covering another
from the chilly air with a blanket picked up on
the field, and doing what I could to relieve their
suffering.</p>
</div>

<p>Morning came, and our brigade remained
near Little Round Top, receiving our full share
of the storm of iron hail, throughout the artillery
duel of the third day. Then came Pickett’s desperate
charge, the final effort of the enemy, who
never got further north than here. Then came
the retreat of the enemy, and our pursuit of them
back into Virginia.</p>

<p>During the battle, my cousin, James A.
Shepard, of the 18th Massachusetts received his
death wound, while going to a spring to fill several
canteens for his comrades. I saw him the
day before the battle bright and cheerful. I
heard he was wounded, but did not learn of his
death until some days after, when a letter from
home gave me the following account of his death
and burial.</p>

<p>He was shot in the shoulder, severing an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
artery, and died in a Philadelphia hospital a few
days after the battle, but lived to see his widowed
mother, who was telegraphed for, at his request.</p>

<p>When she arrived at the hospital, she
stood a moment at the door of the ward where
her boy lay on his deathbed, and where the long
rows of beds and their occupants all looked alike
to her; she heard his voice at the further end of
the room, saying “Oh mother, mother! here I am
come quick!” and soon the heartbroken mother
knelt by his bedside, while he, happy in her presence,
talked of the battle and tried to comfort
her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know I’ve got to die,” he said, “But never
mind, mother dear, it is in a glorious cause, and
we whipped the rebels good!” Poor boy, he was
only twenty, yet was willing to die for his country!</p>
</div>

<p>As he grew weaker, he talked of the dear
ones at home, and wished he could have bade
them goodbye.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Kiss them for me, mother,” he said, “And
take me home, and lay me beside my father, and
put some flowers on my grave from the dear old
home garden, that I have so longed to see!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>His mother remained with him until he
died, and through untold difficulties, she brought
his body home, being obliged to smuggle it part
of the way, and now, in the family lot, he lies beside
his father and mother. Two of his brothers
also lie buried there, Charles, who served in the
Massachusetts heavy artillery, and George, who
was badly wounded in the head while serving in
the navy; he never fully recovered, and died soon
after the war ended.</p>

<p>We crossed the river near Berlin, keeping
east of the Blue Ridge. At Manassas Gap on
July 23rd, we saw some pretty fighting by the
Third Corps, and on the 8th of August, we went
into camp at Beverly Ford, and remained five
weeks, enjoying our well earned rest. Here I
saw five deserters shot. Sept. 15th we moved to
Culpepper, where I saw a bounty jumper drummed
out of camp, branded with the letter D. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
we received 180 recruits, and between October
10th and 29th, we were marching back and forth,
to one point and then another, as though our
generals thought we needed exercise.</p>

<p>November 29th, 1863 found us in line of
battle at Mine Run. For three days and nights
we faced the enemy, and awaited the signal to
open the battle. I shall never forget one night,
the coldest I ever saw in Virginia. Mine Run
was a little stream of water made formidable by
the rebels, whose works were back of it. The
stream was filled with thorny bushes and brush,
now frozen in; when across that, there was a
strong abattis made of sharpened timber, that
must be removed before we could charge the enemy,
strongly entrenched behind earthworks.
Not much charging could be done in that situation,
and we old soldiers knew the hopelessness
of such an attempt.</p>

<p>We knew that the order had been given
to charge on the enemy’s works at daybreak.
We felt rather gloomy, for we knew that death
was certain, if we made that desperate attempt.
For my part, I had faced many dangers, had been
under fire many times, but had never felt, as I
did then, that death stared me in the face. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
horrors of that bitter cold night can never be
told. All night long we had to keep in motion
to avoid freezing to death, for no fire could we
have, lest we be discovered by the enemy; more
than one poor fellow was frozen to death in the
rifle pits.</p>

<p>Morning came at last, but we heard no
order to charge. All honor to General Meade,
who has been censured for his failure to charge
across Mine Run. With all his bravery, he was
too humane to order such a useless sacrifice of
life, though he knew he incurred censure and
probably disgrace, in ordering a retreat instead.
Silently we retreated out of our dangerous situation,
and made our way towards Stephensburg.
Hungry and cold as we were, we hurried along,
halting now and then just long enough to build
a little fire and boil some coffee, the soldier’s
best friend.</p>

<p>Towards night it grew warmer, and when
the order came to halt for the night on an open
plain, we were too tired to do anything but drop
in our tracks, rolled up in our rubber blankets.
When we awoke in the morning, we found that
several inches of snow had fallen during the
night, and covered that vast body of sleeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
men as with a white and fleecy blanket. We
soon had fires and a warm breakfast. By ten
o’clock the snow had melted, and we took up our
march with renewed courage.</p>

<p>Our army crossed to the north side of the
Rappahannock river, and two days after found
us encamped at Liberty, near Bealton Station, on
the Orange and Alexandria railroad, and here we
had a brief respite from our toils and dangers.</p>

A LETTER FROM THE FRONT.</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Halt! Who goes there?” My challenge cry,</div>
<div class="indent">It rings along the watchful line,</div>
<div class="verse">“Relief!” I hear a voice reply;</div>
<div class="indent">“Advance and give the countersign!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Unknown.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="right">Camp at Liberty Va., Dec.—1863.</p>

<p>You ask me about our daily life, and now,
while “All is quiet upon the Potomac,” I will
try to give you some idea of company B’s life in
camp. Reveille is sounded at sunrise; our company
falls into line, and the first sergeant calls
the roll.</p>

<p>Each man then cooks his own breakfast,
except when two or three tentmates agree to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
turns. In my case, my tentmate does the cooking,
and I get the wood and water. Our rations
when in camp are generally hardtack, pork, salt,
sugar, coffee, beans, potatoes, fresh meat, etc.,
but we do not draw all of these things at once;
some days we will draw hardtack and pork, sugar
and coffee; on other days, fresh meat, and potatoes.</p>

<p>In drawing rations for the regiment, the
quartermaster draws up a requisition for as many
rations as there are men in the regiment; they
are sent to regimental headquarters, and divided
among the companies. The first sergeant of
each company receives it, and divides it among
the men.</p>

<p>One day’s rations consists of ten hardtack,
half a pound of salt pork, a few spoonfuls of
coffee, and the same of sugar. In drawing
fresh meat, it is cut up into pieces, the orderly
calls the roll, beginning one day at A, and the
next at Z, and as each man’s name is called, he
steps up, takes his choice of the meat, and the
last is “Hobson’s choice.”</p>

<p>After breakfast, surgeon’s call is sounded,
and if sick or unfit for duty, the boys report to
him; he gives them pills or quinine, and reports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
them either fit for duty, or sick in quarters.
His word is law, and if he understands his calling,
he seldom makes mistakes; but I have known
many instances where men have been reported
for duty, who were not fit to be out of their
bed.</p>

<p>Next, the orderly makes the detail for
camp guard, police, picket, etc. At 8 o’clock
A. M., camp guard is placed on duty around the
camp, and remains so for twenty-four hours, two
hours on post, and four off. Those detailed for
police duty, are placed under a non-commissioned
officer, and set to cleaning up camp.</p>

<p>The pickets fall in, and after all the details
from the various companies get together,
they are marched to the front, and are posted so
that the whole front is guarded, relieving those
that have been on duty. They remain on duty
for twenty-four hours, two hours on post, and
four off, except when very near the enemy, in an
exposed position, then they sometimes remain for
several days.</p>

<p>After the pickets go on duty, we who are
not detailed for duty, have about two hours to
ourselves, in which to wash and mend our clothes,
clean our rifles and equipments, etc. At 10.30<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
o’clock we go on company drill, which lasts an
hour, after which, we get our dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner we have battalion drill, brigade
drill, or something else to keep us busy, and
out of mischief.</p>

<p>Dress parade comes at sunset, tattoo at 9
o’clock, taps at 9.30; all lights must then be out,
and the army is at rest.</p>

<p>It was at Liberty that most of the members
of the 32nd Massachusetts re-enlisted for
three years more. I was not the first to re-enlist;
I knew now what a soldier’s life really was.
I realized that my father knew what he was talking
about, when he told me that it was no holiday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
picnic, and that the men of the South were as
brave as those of the North, and that it would
take years instead of months to conquer them,
as so many thought when the war began. I had
endured two years of hardships and dangers, and
longed for a peaceful life with those I loved at
home. I knew my dear old father would be
grieved, were I to again enlist.</p>

<p>I fought it all out alone on picket, that
cold long night, went back to camp, and with
fingers almost too stiff with cold to hold the pen,
signed my name to the paper that bound me to
the service of my country for “Three years more,
or until the close of the war.”</p>

<p>Yes, I had made up my mind, that come
what would, I would see it out! My country
needed me; dire disaster had overtaken it, dark
and gloomy was the situation, and now more than
ever, were needed strong and willing hands to defend
it; and so I would do my duty, and leave
the rest to God.</p>

<p>And now, looking back over the long years
since that day, I can truly say, I have never
regretted my decision. The terrible year that
followed would have been included in my first
term of enlistment of three years, and so I did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
serve quite a year longer than I would have done,
if I had not re-enlisted. Many a poor fellow
who felt that three years was enough, and that
he could not endure such a life any longer than
that, and consequently did not re-enlist, lost his
life in the battle summer that followed. But
none could foresee the future, and the close of
the war looked to us in the field, as a long way
ahead.</p>

<p>So many of the regiment re-enlisted that
we were given 30 days furlough, and allowed to
go home as a regiment. We had previously had
re-enforcements from time to time, so that there
were 340 who re-enlisted, and started for home,
arriving in Fall River by the New York boat, on
January 17th, 1864.</p>

<p>As the day of our arrival was the Sabbath,
which we dimly remembered was kept sacred at
the North, the commanding officer telegraphed
to Governor Andrew to know if it would do to
take his men through Boston on the Sabbath
day. He quickly received the answer, “Come
right along!” So he issued orders to the men to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
be as orderly as possible, and not shock the pious
people of the Puritan state, and we took the
train to Boston.</p>

<p>How astonished the war-worn soldiers
were at their reception! Ours was the first Massachusetts
regiment returning with the proud title
of “Veteran,” and the people had turned out
<i>en masse</i> to do us honor. We marched through
crowded streets to the State House, where we received
a welcome from the Governor, and a salute
was fired in our honor, on the Common;
then to Faneuil Hall, where a most sumptuous
dinner was prepared for us, of which we were
invited to partake, by the Mayor of Boston.</p>

<p>After dinner, Governor Andrew made an
address that will, I think, ever be remembered
by the members of the old 32nd. I cannot remember
all he said, but some of his eloquent
words still linger in my memory:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot, soldiers of the Union Army, by words, in a fitting
measure, repeat your praise. This battle-flag, riddled with
shot and torn with shell, is more eloquent than human voice, more
pathetic than song. This flag tells what you have done, it reveals
what you have borne, and it shall be preserved as long as a thread
remains, a memorial of your valor and patriotism.</p>

<p>I give you praise from a grateful heart, in behalf of a
grateful people, for all you have suffered, and all you have accomplished;
and while I welcome you to your homes, where the war-worn
soldier may rest a brief while, I do not forget your comrades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
in arms who have fallen, fighting for that flag, defending the rights
and honor of our common country. The humblest soldiers who have
given their lives away, will be remembered as long as our country
shall preserve its history.</p>
</div>

<p>As the people gazed on the torn and
blackened remnant of the beautiful silk flag we
had borne away with us two years before, it
seemed to tell more eloquently than words could
do, of battles won and lost. And now, after the
lapse of thirty-four years, it still, with other battle
flags, is preserved in a glass case in the State
House at Boston. If you should look for it
there, it might be difficult to find it among the
many handsome banners hanging there, for it
is a mere strip of silk that seems to be just
hanging by a few threads to the staff, a black
and ragged remnant of the beautiful silk flag we
took with us to the front; but we old soldiers are
far more proud of it than we were in the days
when it was first presented to us, before it had
been consecrated by the blood of the brave boys
who bore it through the storm of battle, and gave
their lives, rather than the flag should be lost to
the regiment. We had a new flag to take back
with us, and that also bears the marks of shot and
shell, and is sacredly preserved.</p>

<p>After the dinner was over, we were dismissed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and I made quick time to New Bedford,
where I received a warm welcome from my father,
who was overjoyed to see me.</p>

<p>The first night at home, I went to bed in
my old room, but could not sleep, the feather
bed was too soft for me; at last I got up, rolled
myself in a blanket, and laid down on the floor,
where I slept like a top. The feather bed was
removed next day, and I slept very comfortably
after that on the straw mattress.</p>

<p>How the happy days flew by, when friends
vied with each other in making my furlough
pleasant for me, and doing their best to spoil my
appetite for army rations, with their cakes, pies,
and all sorts of good things!</p>

<p>But all too soon we had to say goodbye.
On February 17th we once more started for the
South, arriving at camp Liberty two days later,
warmly welcomed by the comrades we had left
there, and proud of the title of “Veteran,” with
all that it implied.</p>

<p>General Grant now took command of the
army, and on April 30th 1864, we broke camp
at Liberty, and began the hardest, most bloody
campaign of the war. Our division gathered
near Rappahannock Station; crossed the river for
the fifteenth time, and marched to Brandy Station,
marching almost constantly. We crossed
the Rapidan at Germania Ford, marched all the
next day, camping at night in the Wilderness,
very near the enemy. May 5th we threw up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
earthworks, but at noon advanced, leaving our
works to other troops. We were soon heavily
engaged, and so began Bloody May.</p>

<p>From this time forward, day and night,
marching, fighting, digging earthworks, there
was no rest for us. From losses in battle, and
from sickness, our regiment again dwindled down
to a company in numbers.</p>

<p>On May 8th we supported the 5th Massachusetts
battery, with some pretty smart fighting.
On the 9th we again went to the front,
and threw up works, behind which we kept pretty
close most of the day. Sharpshooters were
plenty in the rebel lines, not far from us. One
of my company, George Erskine, who was near
me in the works, sat on a cracker box, and turned
his head to speak to me, thereby exposing himself
a little, and as I was looking at him, I saw a
bullet strike the side of his head, go through it,
and strike the ground. He gave one sigh, and
fell dead at my feet. It was the work of a rebel
sharpshooter.</p>

<p>A little later in the day, the orderly sergeant
asked—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Who will go out on the skirmish line?”</p>
</div>

<p>The skirmish line was about a third of a mile in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
front of us, and to reach it, one had to run the
gauntlet, for the enemy had a fair view of the
whole field, and they improved it, you may be
sure.</p>

<p>Several comrades volunteered, and went
under a sharp fire. I felt a little ashamed of
myself for not going too, so I said to my chum,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If he calls for more, I am going!”</p>

<p>“I go if you do,” said dear old Dwight, and
soon the word came again,</p>

<p>“Who will volunteer?”</p>

<p>“I will go for one!” Said I, and Dwight said
the same.</p>
</div>

<p>Over the works we went, the minie balls
singing and zipping at us as we made our best
time over that open field. We reached the line
all right, and settled down to business.</p>

<p>After a time I found my ammunition was
getting low, and by the time it was all gone, it
was growing dark, so that we could move round
with less danger, for we could not show ourselves
without drawing the fire of the sharpshooters, so
at dark I went round among the dead, and took
all the ammunition I could find, and began again
where I left off. We remained within two hundred
yards of the enemy’s works all night. During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the night, our officers sent us plenty of ammunition,
and informed us that we were to charge
at noon next day, and that we were to fall into
line as they advanced, but for some reason, the
expected charge was delayed.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>S. D. Richardson.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For two or three days we remained on the
skirmish line, digging rifle pits to protect ourselves
from the fire of the enemy. These were
holes in the ground deep enough for one or more
men to stand in, and if we showed our heads we
were pretty sure to draw their attention, so we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
kept out of sight as much as possible. But our
greatest peril was from our own line, a quarter
of a mile in the rear of us, for there were several
pieces of artillery continually sending shells and
solid shot over our heads into the enemy’s lines,
and some of them were too near us for comfort and
safety, for we were on slightly rising ground in
front of them, and the gunners, to do more execution,
depressed their pieces so much that every now
and then a shot or shell would skim by, or over
us, as we hugged the ground.</p>

<p>We would watch for the flash of the guns,
and drop to the ground, so the shot generally
went over us. In the rifle pit with me were two
of my comrades, one of whom had taken off his
haversack, and laid it near by. A shot from our
line struck that haversack, and sent it flying in
every direction.</p>

<p>Comrade Flint was fairly peppered with
pieces of tin plate, cup, knife, fork and spoon,
which wounded him severely in several places.
He stood the pain as long as he could, and finally
said he was going back to the lines; we advised
him to wait until dark, but the pain was so great
that he could not, and he started on the run across
the open field, back to our main line. Instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
he was a target for the rebel sharpshooters.
We watched him anxiously, and once saw
him go down, but he was up and off in a moment,
and reached our lines, where he went into
the hospital.</p>

<p>He received a wound in the leg, from
which he never fully recovered. The other
wounds healed after a while, but left indelible
scars.</p>

<p>Soon after, the firing ceased, and we felt
better, when we were no longer in danger from
our own artillery.</p>

<p>At last, on the morning of the 12th came
the order to attack, and our gallant little brigade
commanded by Colonel Prescott, dashed across
the field as far as the foot of Laurel Hill. How
our brave boys charged those works under that
heavy shower of grape and canister, none who
survived will ever forget!</p>

<p>But we could not take the works, and had
to fall back, under a galling fire from their whole
line. Oh! What a shower of death came down
upon us! Before we got our colors back to our
old position, the 32nd had lost five color bearers,
and one hundred and three, out of one hundred
and ninety men, killed or wounded. A number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
of the boys of our company lay killed or wounded
upon the field we had charged over, and the
constant firing along the whole line of the enemy’s
works, made it dangerous business going
out to bring them in; but several of us determined
to do so, in spite of the risk we incurred.</p>

<p>Before leaving home we had made a solemn
promise to each other, that no man should
be left unburied or uncared for on the field; that
we would risk life and limbs that our wounded
should be cared for, and our dead comrades tenderly
laid in the bosom of mother earth. We
usually waited until night before going out after
our fallen comrades, but we could see the poor
fellows lying there under the scorching sun, and
felt that some of them would not hold out until
night.</p>

<p>Taking a blanket for a stretcher, four of
us started out on the run, drawing upon us a
deadly fire from the enemy. One of our party
fell, wounded in the leg, but the rest managed to
take him along in our hasty retreat. Again and
again we made the attempt, succeeding in getting
most of our wounded under cover.</p>

<p>Night came, and we started out to bury
our dead. Many a poor fellow lying upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
face, did I turn over in my search for my comrades
that night. Suddenly I came upon one of
my company, still living, but mortally wounded.
He had been shot through the spine, and could
not be moved, so I made him as comfortable as
possible by putting a blanket under his head, and
giving him some water. His sufferings were terrible,
but soon over; he knew his time had come,
and gave me messages for his folks and friends
at home.</p>

<p>I promised him that I would write and
let them know how, and when he died, and that
I would see that he was buried. I remained with
him until death released him from his agony,
then closed his eyes, and covered him with his
blanket.</p>

<p>Sadly I left him, and moved on to where
I could hear a well known voice calling for help.
It was another of my company badly wounded,
but able to be moved, so I hastily rolled him into
a blanket, and we soon had him within our
line.</p>

<p>Busy all night, when daylight came, we
had buried our dead, and gathered in our wounded,
thus fulfilling the compact that was never
broken when it was possible for us to keep it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
What a comfort it was to us, that solemn promise,
for, far worse than death, was the thought
of lying exposed and unburied on the battlefield.
That night was a sad one, never to be forgotten
by me, when we rolled our comrades up in their
blankets, and laid them in graves that will forever
remain unknown.</p>

THE WILDERNESS CAMPAIGN.</h2>

</div></div></div>

<p>From the 12th to the 23rd, our regiment
was constantly under fire from the enemy in
front of us, at Spotsylvania Courthouse, and
vicinity, continually changing our location, throwing
up earthworks each night after a weary day’s
march, before we could roll ourselves in our
blankets, and take our short night’s rest.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd, we took up
our line of march towards the North Anna river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
crossing it at Jericho Ford, our brigade advancing
at once in line of battle into a piece of
woods, where we had a skirmish with the enemy,
who fell back, and we proceeded to fell trees, and
build a line of works.</p>

<p>Before we had finished them, the enemy
in force, under General Hill, attacked us, and
endeavored to drive us out of our works and into
the river. The assault fell mainly upon our division.
Our regiment was on the left of the
line of battle, and we did our best to give them
a warm reception. For the first time since the
campaign began, we fought in our works. It
was a short, sharp fight, and the enemy was repulsed.</p>

<p>We remained in our works until morning,
when we moved on towards Hanover Junction,
but on May 26th we received orders to retire,
which we did during the night, and once more
crossed the North Anna river at Quarles Ford,
and marched almost constantly for twenty-four
hours towards the Pamunky river.</p>

<p>We next met the enemy near Mechanicsville,
on the morning of the 30th of May. Little
did we think then, that in the future years, that
day would be set apart for honoring the memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of the fallen sons of the nation, our brigade advanced
in line of battle through Tolopotomy
Swamp, driving the confederate skirmishers until
we came to open fields near Shady Grove Church,
where we found the enemy in force behind earthworks.</p>

<p>We could not take them, so kept back as
much as we could, out of range, yet our loss during
the day was twenty-two, killed or wounded.
I shall never forget our march through Tolopotomy
woods, keeping in line, over briars and fallen
trees and stumps. Our shoes were worn out
with twenty five days of constant marching and
fighting, and we were about as bad off ourselves.
But we got there all the same, and staid there
until midnight, when we were relieved by a part
of the Ninth Corps, and went into camp, where
we remained on the reserve for two or three
days.</p>

<p>We took this time to do a little much
needed washing, for we had no change of clothing,
being in very light marching order. During
our long marches, often, when we came to a
stream, have I taken off my shirt, given it a hasty
wash, wrung it out, put it on again, and gone
on my way rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Perhaps the simple record kept in my
diary during that “Bloody May,” as it has been
so often called, will give some idea of the life we
led when we were constantly confronting the enemy,
with, as we might well say, a musket in one
hand, and a shovel in the other; we could not
stop to rest without first shoveling up earthworks
to protect us from the fire of the ever active enemy.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Rev. Minot J Savage.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the 3rd of June, before daylight, we
were called up to do our part in the battle of
Cold Harbor. The troops that had relieved us
at the front the day before had been driven from
their works, and our division was called upon to
re-take them.</p>

<p>It was the same along the whole line. We
were to charge across an open field, under a terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
fire from the enemy, strongly entrenched
behind earthworks. Between our line of works
and that of the enemy, the ground was covered
with pine trees, felled and fastened across each
other, and in addition, they had posted a battery
in a position that could sweep the entire unsheltered
field. We heard afterwards that Lee had
been two weeks getting ready for us.</p>

<p>It was about half past four on that bright
June morning, that we started on that memorable
charge. Never shall I forget the storm of
bullets, grape and canister that was rained upon
us. My comrades fell on my right and left till I
thought there would be none left to tell the tale.
Half way across, my shoe became untied, and I
knew that I would lose it unless I tied it up again,
so down on one knee I went, and tied my
shoe.</p>

<p>My comrades saw me drop, and I heard
a shout, “Mosby’s hit!” I was up in an instant,
and on with the rest. On we went until we
reached the works, from which we drove the enemy,
but they only fell back to their own line of
works, about two hundred yards away. We remained
in the recaptured works, and kept up a
constant exchange of fire all day long; on neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
side could a man show his head without being
shot at, but we hindered them as much as we
could from using their battery upon us.</p>

<p>I remember one poor fellow of my company,
who had somehow gone to a part of our
line where the enemy had a raking fire right among
us. I noticed him lying there as though
asleep, but I well knew that no one living could
sleep in that place, and concluded that he must
be dead. I offered to help his brother bring him
in, but he demurred, fearing that he might share
the same fate. We did not know what moment
we might have to leave, and did not want to leave
a dead comrade unburied.</p>

<p>At last four of us started after the body,
and succeeded, under a terrific shower of bullets
that drove us back more than once, in getting
him onto a blanket, and each one holding a corner,
we made quick time into the rifle pits. We
rolled the poor fellow in the blanket, and buried
him in one of the rifle pits; many a poor fellow
was buried in that way.</p>

<p>There was a peach orchard between the
lines, and when the battle ended at dark, there
was not much left of it but the trunks of the
trees. All day I kept pegging away. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
my gun got too foul from constant firing, I poured
in a little water, washed it out, snapped a cap
or two, and I was ready for action again. I was
not sorry however, when nightfall put an end to
the conflict, and I could drop down and rest.</p>

<p>Another charge was ordered before night,
all along the line, but the order was countermanded,
thus saving many precious lives. The
loss of our army that day was over thirteen
thousand men, our regimental loss being ten
killed, and twenty-one wounded.</p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak I heard
the orderly call my name, and reported to him
immediately, and received the order with others,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the skirmish line!”</p>
</div>

<p>While I stood waiting a few moments for the
skirmishers to get together, I noticed a Johnny
Reb walking over to our line; I thought he wanted
to come in, so I shouted to him to come on
in; he stopped and looked at me a moment as
though surprised, then turned on his heel, and
walked back from whence he came, taking no
notice of my invitation to come in, and threat to
shoot him if he didn’t. I would not have shot
the brave fellow anyway, and I watched him
walk deliberately back until he reached the works,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
when he leaped over them and ran for the woods
like a deer. We concluded that he was a straggler
who had been asleep somewhere, and did
not know of the changed conditions, and thought
his side still held the advanced line; at any rate,
he found out the difference before it was too
late.</p>

<p>Only a few moments elapsed before we
were ready for the start, and away we went, expecting
every minute the rebels would rise above
their works, and put an end to us all. But all
was quiet in front, so we kept on until we stood
upon their works, and found that during the
night the enemy had left for parts unknown.
Upon a cracker box cover they had left the loving
message,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Come on, you damned Yanks to Richmond,
but you will find it a rough road to travel, with
a Hill, and two Longstreets to go over before
you get there!”</p>
</div>

<p>You can imagine how surprised we were
to find the works abandoned that our leaders had
thought it impossible to capture by assault, and
how thankful we were that we had not made the
charge that the enemy had evidently expected,
and so had prudently withdrawn, under cover of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
darkness. They had succeeded in removing their
battery that had so raked us all day, but the heap
of dead horses, a dozen or more, that lay near the
position they had occupied, showed that they had
made several attempts before they accomplished
their purpose.</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, General Grant
changed his plan of operations, and started us off
for the James river. Our corps crossed the
Chickahominy river at Long Bridge, marched
southward to the James river, and on the 16th of
June, the Army of the Potomac was on the
right bank of the James, preparing for a fresh
start in another direction. As we went up in
front of Petersburg on the 18th of June, we
were double quicked across an open field, and
made a dash on the Norfolk railroad, where we
made a stand.</p>

<p>It was in this charge that our beloved
colonel, George L. Prescott, fell mortally wounded,
while leading his men. He died the next
day, and the whole brigade mourned his loss; he
was a brave soldier, and a good man; always
kind to his men, he treated them like brothers.</p>

<p>Many a time have I known him to let a
sick man have his blanket, and then bunk in
with a private who was lucky enough to have
such an article. More than once has he slept
with me, rolled up in the same blanket, and I always
felt that in him I had a true friend. By
his kind and generous words and deeds he had
endeared himself to the whole brigade, and today
many an old veteran reveres his memory, even as
I do.</p>

<p>His body was brought home, and buried
with his kindred in Sleepy Hollow cemetery, at
Concord, Mass. I have visited his grave since
the war, and as I stood in the pleasant spot where
he sleeps so peacefully, I could but recall the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
memories of that terrible scene, when he laid his
life on the altar of his country.</p>

<p>We had hot work all that day; again we
charged the enemy, and drove them into their
last line of works. This enabled us to establish
our line on the crest of the hill. Near this place
the mine was made that was exploded on the
30th of July, a little over a month later.</p>

<p>It was in this charge that a minie ball
grazed my check, which soon swelled so that my
comrades hardly recognized me. For a week or
more, my jaw was rather stiff and sore, so that I
could not eat hard bread; this made it rather inconvenient,
as I was blessed with a good appetite
and could not get much else but the old reliable
“Hard tack” to eat, but I was not disabled, and
did my duty as usual.</p>

<p>It was about noon, during a lull in the
fight, that we saw a large turkey strut proudly
into the centre of a deep ravine, that lay between
us and the enemy’s lines. Instantly every musket
in our company was aimed at that poor turkey
gobbler. When the smoke cleared away,
we saw him still undisturbed in his foraging; we
stood astonished until one of us happened to remember
that our guns were sighted for 200 yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
distance. He hastily lowered the sight, and
spang went the deadly messenger into the heart
of that devoted bird. When the fight was over,
we picked up the fowl, and cooked him for our
supper.</p>

<p>That night we spent in throwing up earthworks
with our bayonets and tin plates, and by
morning we had some works from which the enemy
could not drive us, though they made
several attempts. Our works were never advanced
beyond this line until Petersburg was
taken.</p>

<p><i>June 1, 1864.</i> Sunset. Another battle has
begun, and brave men are now falling for their
country and their homes. Ah, many a heart
will mourn when they hear of this hour’s history,
but may the thought cheer them, that their dear
ones fell like heroes, as they are, in the holiest
cause for which man ever fought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span><i>June 2.</i> Five P. M. Again has the battle
begun, and again we hear the hum of lead and
iron, like hail in a storm. Oh, how terrible is
the conflict of arms among men of one nation!</p>

<p><i>June 3.</i> The battle began early this morning,
and now many of my dear comrades are cold in
death. Many others are suffering with pain
from wounds received while facing traitors to
their country.</p>
</div>

<p>At six o’clock this morning we charged
across a field about a quarter of a mile; fighting
began, and we had it hot and heavy until dark.
Our loss was very heavy, and of my company,
Warren P. Locke, and Makepeace C. Young are
killed, and Hazen, Kennison, Robinson, Melvin,
Parsons, Beals, Uffindale, and Fuller are wounded.
Oh, may their names be ever honored by
those who love their country!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>June 4.</i> Went out skirmishing; relieved at
noon, and joined my company. Started for
some place, and went about one mile, then back
we went to the front, and staid all night.</p>

<p><i>June 5.</i> Laid behind our works until four P.
M., then with two other regiments, we went out
on a reconnoissance; skirmishing began soon after
starting, and we fell back to our works, got our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
rations, and fooled around all night.</p>

<p><i>June 13.</i> Started at eight o’clock last night,
and marched until half past four this morning,
when we halted near the Chickahominy river;
laid down an hour, then up and going again.
Stopped for breakfast at seven o’clock. Crossed
the Chickahominy, and went about a mile, then
halted until dark; then packed up and started for
Charles City courthouse. Stopped at midnight.</p>

<p><i>June 14.</i> Once more back on the James river.
I little thought one year ago that I should
ever return here. But where are my companions
that were with me then? Some are lying beneath
Virginia soil, others are wounded in the
hospitals, and others are at home with their
friends; but I am still in my country’s service,
fighting for the Nation that was given to us by
our forefathers.</p>

<p><i>June 18.</i> This day will ever be fresh in my
memory, for through the mercy of God, my life
was spared, when death certainly stared me in
the face. While men fell all around me, I was
left unharmed. It was a desperate attempt to
carry the enemy’s works; we charged three times
and were repulsed each time, with terrible loss.
Our Colonel fell, fatally wounded, while leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
his men in the charge. Major Edmunds was
wounded; William R. Wait was killed, and
Wheeler and many others of my company were
wounded.</p>

<p><i>June 19.</i> Col. Prescott died of his wounds today
at 11 A. M. He was a good and brave man
and we deeply feel his loss.</p>

<p><i>July 30.</i> Before Petersburg. Battle opened
all along the line before sunrise this morning.
About as heavy artillery firing as I ever heard.
There is hard fighting on the left and centre of
our line.</p>

<p><i>August 18.</i> On guard last night; packed up
at three this morning, and moved to the left
across the Weldon railroad, and tore up the rails.
Heavy fighting all day; was on the skirmish line;
Melvin of my company wounded; was relieved
from the skirmish line at 10 o’clock tonight.</p>

<p><i>August 21.</i> Sunday; on the Weldon railroad;
just got my breakfast down when the outposts of
our line were driven in; we opened fire, but were
driven back to our works, then we advanced,
skirmishing all the way back to our old picket
line.</p>

<p>After our line of entrenchments was established,
our brigade was ordered to the rear,
and we encamped along the Jerusalem plank
road, where we were held in reserve for special
duty. Here we worked day and night building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
a large earthen fort, which we named in honor
of our lamented Col. Prescott. Here Major
Edmunds was appointed colonel, and took command
of the regiment.</p>

<p>We remained in reserve about three weeks,
during which time we were called upon to re-enforce
the Second and Sixth Corps, on two occasions.
On July 12th we were ordered into the
trenches, where we lived in bomb proofs for five
weeks, one of the hardest experiences of my
army life. These bomb proofs were a sort of
artificial cavern, which we had to construct under
cover of darkness, for the enemy was continually
sending over to our lines solid shot and hissing
shells, and only in our bomb proofs, (and not always
there,) were we out of danger from them.</p>

<p>To build a bomb proof we dug a hole in
the ground about four feet deep if the ground
was dry, but where our regiment was located it
was so springy that two feet brought us to water
so most of ours were partly above ground; after
the hole is dug, the top was roofed over with logs,
and dirt thrown on top of them. A small space
was left open towards our rear for a door to go
in and out of, which was sheltered by a log canopy.
Here we had to stay, and hot, uncomfortable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
and unhealthy places they proved to be,
and it is no wonder that many of our men were
taken from them to the hospital, sick with malarial
fever, from which some of them never recovered.</p>

<p>I remember one hot night, my chum and
I pitched a tent two or three steps in the rear of
our bomb proof under a pine tree, and there we
went to sleep. Before morning, the active enemy
in front began shelling our line, and we were
awakened by the falling of the branches upon
our tent, having been cut off by a passing shot.
Soon another shot came and struck the tree, and
my bedfellow made one leap out of the tent into
the bomb proof. The next shot struck the tree
still lower, and I too forsook my bed for the
safer, though uncomfortable hole in the ground.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the guns in front of us
were silent, we would sit on the bomb proofs in
the evening, and watch the shells of the enemy,
as they came over on to some other part of our
entrenchments. It was a beautiful sight, far beyond
any fireworks I have ever witnessed, if we
could only forget their deadly errand.</p>

<p>On the 30th of July occurred the explosion
of the Burnside mine, that we had made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
digging a passage to and under one of the rebel
forts, and laying powder enough to destroy it.
The plan had been carefully laid, and an attack
contemplated simultaneous with the explosion,
which would carry their line.</p>

<p>The blowing up of that mine was a horrible
affair, and caused much slaughter, but for
some reason, the attack was not a success. The
artillery opened all along our line, on that eventful
morning, as a signal for the beginning of the
fight.</p>

<p>Near our bomb proof was a battery,
which was so located that in firing, it would rake
the rebel picket line on our left. The Captain
of the battery knew that the first round would
almost annihilate them, and wanted to give them
a chance for their lives, so he wrote a note, telling
them if they would leave their position and
come over to us, they would save their lives; he
then called for a volunteer to carry the note.
Instantly a brave boy of our regiment stepped
forward. He was told that it was a dangerous
mission, and that he was risking his life, for he
would certainly be shot at. His only reply was,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Give me the message, I will go.”</p>
</div>

<p>Holding up the white paper, he deliberately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
walked across the open space to the rebel picket
line, handed one of them the note, saying,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Here you Johnnies, read that!”</p>
</div>

<p>He came back at the same moderate pace
and strangely enough, was not shot at going
or coming. All seemed astonished into silence
at his daring, but he was loudly cheered, when he
reached our line in safety.</p>

<p>The warning was in vain; the brave fellows
would not desert their post, neither would
they retreat without orders. Again came the
order to rake their line; the order was obeyed,
and two-thirds of the poor men were swept into
eternity.</p>

<p>The captain of the battery was disgusted
with such butchery. He could have fired on an
advancing foe without scruple, but to fire on a
thin picket line was too cold blooded for him,
and he swore that he would not fire another shot
in that direction, and he kept his word.</p>

<p>On the 16th of August we were relieved
from the trenches. On the 18th we made an attack
on the Weldon railroad, in order to cut off
the supplies of the rebel forces in front of Petersburg.
In this action our regiment lost thirteen
men. The railroad was too strongly guarded for
our attempt to succeed.</p>

<p>We were called upon frequently to repel
attacks from the enemy, and continually kept
busy until the 1st of September, when we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
again ordered to the trenches for a few days.
We were soon relieved however, for our services
were required in another direction.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September the Fifth and
Ninth corps made a charge on the rebel Fort
McRea. We formed our line in a piece of
woods, bringing the 32nd Massachusetts directly
in front of the fort, and the 4th Michigan on our
right. We had to cross an open field, and the
enemy’s batteries opened on us directly, but we
went on steadily until we were in range of the
rebel rifles, then we made a dash, and soon reached
the fort.</p>

<p>Our colonel received a wound in the leg,
and Col. Welch of the 4th Michigan fell mortally
wounded. The first to mount the parapet was
an officer of our regiment; he jumped the deep
ditch in front of the fort, and swinging his sword
above his head, shouted to us to follow him; he
was followed by several officers, who jumped the
ditch and rushed into the fort. We soon followed
them, though being encumbered with our
equipments, we could not as easily jump the
ditch as the officers. I jumped into the moat,
and shouted to a Johnny Reb to help me up the
slope; he shook his head, so I brought my gun to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
my shoulder and threatened to shoot him. He
reached out his hand and helped me up the
bank.</p>

<p>Corporal Lewis Chesbro of my company,
instead of climbing the bank, ran around to the
rear of the fort, where he saw a rebel gunner
sighting a piece of artillery towards a portion of
our division that had not reached the works.
Chesbro instantly shot the gunner, then tried in
vain to turn the piece around. Seeing me inside
the fort, he called for me to help him. Together
we turned it partly round and sighted it at another
of the rebel pieces of artillery, with which
they were trying to escape.</p>

<p>The shot killed the two lead horses; the
driver jumped down and cut the dead horses clear
and managed to save the gun for us to face again
the same day. After we had taken the first line
of works, the Ninth corps passed to the front to
take the second line. General Charles S. Griffin
our commander, told us that we had done our
duty well, and had done enough for one day, so
we stacked arms and dropped down to rest.</p>

<p>Just at dusk, an aide came riding swiftly
to our line, with the message that the left of the
troops in front of us had broke, and our assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
was wanted. The order came clear and
sharp:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fall in! Take arms! Left face! Forward
double quick, march!”</p>
</div>

<p>General Griffin took the lead, shouting,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Follow me!”</p>
</div>

<p>Away we went to where the troops had broke,
and oh, what confusion! Shells bursting, men
running here and there, every one for himself,
and above all the noise was heard the rebel yell,
once heard, never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Our brigade passed through the retreating
men, and began firing, to check if possible, the
enemy’s advance. This we did, and drove them
back to their old position.</p>

<p>Here I saw a sight which in all the confusion
and excitement thrilled me with admiration,
something not often seen in action under any
circumstances. The 155th Pennsylvania regiment
of our brigade was on our right, firing by
rank, and as cool as if on dress parade, and they
continued so to do until we retired, leaving the
recovered position for the Ninth corps to hold.
Griffin’s “Fighting brigade” was composed of
seasoned veterans, and of them all, none were
braver or bolder than the 155th Penn. volunteers.</p>

<p>In October 1864, the re-enlisted men of
the Ninth, Eighteenth, and Twenty-second Mass.
Volunteers were transferred to our regiment,
and we once more showed full ranks on parade.
By a re-organization of our division, we were
transferred to the Third brigade, now made up
of veteran regiments and called the “Veteran
Brigade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>As the weather grew colder, we went into
winter quarters on the Jerusalem plank road,
and built ourselves good log huts with chimneys,
and proceeded to make ourselves comfortable,
hoping we might be allowed to rest awhile.</p>

<p>But it was not to be, for on the 6th of
December we had to leave our snug quarters and
start off on the march, taking three days rations,
and forty rounds of ammunition. We marched
but three miles that day, and camped for the
night by the roadside, not a very pleasant place
on a cold winter’s night.</p>

<p>Next day, after marching twelve miles,
we found ourselves on the bank of the Nottoway
river. We crossed it at midnight, and reached
Sussex courthouse about daylight; stopped for
breakfast, and after a short rest, resumed our
march. At three o’clock in the afternoon we
reached the Weldon railroad, about five miles
from Jarrett’s Station.</p>

<p>Here we began tearing up the rails, and
destroyed the road for about fifteen miles. We
burned the sleepers, heated the rails in the flame,
and twisted them all out of shape; some we wound
around trees, and rendered them all completely
useless. It was a long, hard job, and the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
night found us bivouacked along the wrecked
railroad.</p>

<p>On the 10th we started on our return to
the front of Petersburg. Through snow and
slush we marched twenty miles, stopping at night
near Sussex courthouse. On this return march
we had to live on the country, as we had taken
but three days’ rations, and were gone six days.
Soon after starting we found three of our boys
on the piazza of a house, with their throats cut.
Apple jack was plenty, and they had probably
drank too much and laid down, and were killed
during their sleep.</p>

<p>We were wild with rage, and the murderers
would have fared hard, had they fell into our
hands. We buried our murdered comrades, and
burned the house. We received orders to burn
all the houses along the route except one, in
which lived a well known Union man. Here I
was left with a file of men as a safe guard until
all our forces had passed. When we left, we received
the heartfelt thanks of the women of the
household.</p>

<p>On the 12th we again went into camp on
the Jerusalem plank road, half a mile from our
starting point. Here we again built our shanties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
which we were allowed to consider as our homes
for some time. The rest was very welcome, and
it gave us time to write to our friends, and receive
letters from home. I will close this chapter
with an extract from my diary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dec. 18.</i> The captain left for home on furlough.
All the members of my company who
did not re-enlist, were mustered out last month,
and are now at home. How I would have liked
to have gone with them! But I must wait, and
hope there is a day coming when I too shall
start for home.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 25.</i> Christmas day. Letters and a diary
from friends at home are very welcome. I have
been very fortunate in receiving letters from
home. The most cheering sound of all to us in
camp is the bugle, “Fall in for the mail!” We
promptly answer the summons, and eagerly listen
as the orderly reads the names. Those who receive
letters wander off by themselves to read them,
those who receive newspapers share them with
others, and still others gloomily stalk off, and
wonder why the home-folks could not send at
least one letter to cheer us on this dreary holiday.
Ah, the time is never wasted, that is spent in
writing to the soldiers at the front, assuring us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
that we are not forgotten in the homes to which
we may never return. We cannot get too
many letters, to help us fight the battles that
must come before the war is over.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 31.</i> On guard in a snow storm. One
year ago I was on picket at Liberty, Va. What
changes have taken place in one short year! Oh
before the close of the next year, may this war
be over, and myself, with all my brave comrades
be at home with our friends. And now the year
is gone with all its sorrow and care, never to return;
but the memories connected with it can
never die; they will ever bring to my mind many
sorrows, and but few joys. So many of my dear
companions in arms, who seemed like brothers,
have been called to lay down their lives, but I
have been spared in life and limb through the
year that is past.</p>

<p>New Years day 1865 found the 32nd
Mass. living in their log huts on the Jerusalem
plank road, one mile in rear of our line of works
in front of Petersburg. Here we worked building
and strengthening our works, taking turns so
that the work went steadily on night and day.
Thus we lived until late in the afternoon of Feb.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
4th, when we received orders to move next
morning at daybreak.</p>

<p>We imagined it was to be another railroad
raid, and we left our huts standing, expecting to
return to them; but in this we were mistaken.
We started at daylight on the 5th, and marched
all day, reaching Nottoway courthouse about sunset.
Here we camped, and pickets were sent out,
but were recalled at midnight, and we again took
up our line of march, arriving early in the morning
at a stream called Hatcher’s run, at a point
where it crossed the Vaughn road, and where
the Second corps had fought the rebels the day
before, while we were marching to re-enforce
them.</p>

<p>We were ordered into some rifle pits on
the opposite side of the stream, out of which the
enemy had been driven. I will try to describe
my own experience in the battle that took place
on February 6th, called by some historians the
battle of Dabney’s Mills, but known to us by the
name of Hatcher’s Run.</p>

<p>Our regiment was on the extreme right of
the Fifth corps, connecting with the Second
corps. About two o’clock in the afternoon,
Crawford’s division advanced from our left across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
our front and engaged the enemy. Two hours
later the veteran brigade was called upon to fill
a gap in Crawford’s line.</p>

<p>We were in the rear, listening to the roar
of battle, and pitying our comrades fighting so
desperately in front of us, not knowing what moment
our turn would come. General Warren
sent an aid to General Griffin, our brigade commander,
with orders to bring us to the front.</p>

<p>The bugle blew the fall-in call, and away
we went into the storm of death. We marched
left in front. When we reached the line engaged
and passed through, the order came,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“File left! Right face!”</p>
</div>

<p>Bringing us into line of battle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Forward, double quick!”</p>
</div>

<p>On we went, not firing a shot. As our ranks
were thinned by the sharp fire poured upon us,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Close to the right!”</p>
</div>

<p>came the order, and we obeyed until we could go
no farther, then came our turn, and we settled
down to business.</p>

<p>The locality of the fight was in a grove of
pines, where we could not see what was going on
around us, and unknown to us, a fresh body of
rebel troops drove back our main line of battle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and we were left alone. Before we fell back we
saw a Johnnie Reb give a signal that he wanted
to come into our lines; in he came, and informed
us that,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You uns will have to get out of this right
smart, for they are putting the whole of Mahone’s
division in front and on the flanks of you uns!”
And in a short time I thought the whole rebel
army was there!</p>
</div>

<p>Our little brigade was pushed back, fighting
all the way, with heavy loss. Our regiment
lost 74 men in killed, wounded, and missing.
The 155th Pennsylvania was on our right, and
that too lost heavily. Here Major Shepard was
taken prisoner; the major, orderly of my company
and myself were on the extreme right, and were
so busily engaged that we did not notice that the
line was falling back, until it was quite a distance
from us. I informed the major, and when we
three started to run, the rebs were not fifty feet
away.</p>

<p>The major’s scabbard tripped him and he
fell; I looked back over my shoulder and saw a
reb on each side of him, and knew he was a prisoner.
This lent wings to my feet, and I expected
every moment to feel a hand on my coat collar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
jerking me back, but I kept on, and the orderly
and I reached the edge of the woods to find an
attempt was being made to rally, in order to save
an ammunition wagon from falling into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>But the attempt was a failure; it was
nearly dark, and some of the new troops in the
second line of battle, seeing us emerge from the
woods, took us to be the Johnnies, and fired into
us. At least half a dozen were killed or wounded
by this volley, and this completed the disaster,
for no troops, veteran or not, could be expected
to rally when attacked on all sides, so we kept on
until we reached our line of works.</p>

<p>Here we remained until the 11th, with
the enemy’s artillery making it very uncomfortable
for us, then we moved to the rear about two
miles, and camped for the night. Next day our
tents and knapsacks came from our old camp,
and we again began building our winter quarters.
Here on the 18th of February as I was building
a chimney to my shanty, I received a sergeant’s
warrant dated the 4th, and on the 20th I acted
as sergeant of the guard for the first time.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we received orders to be
ready to move at a moment’s notice, and that no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
more furloughs were to be given, and everything
looked as though another fight was at hand, but
we remained here until the opening of the final
campaign of the war.</p>

<p>About the 18th of February I sent in an
application for a furlough; I hardly expected to
get it, as all furloughs had been refused, except
in some cases, where an exceptional reason was
urged, or strong influence brought to bear. I
felt, after the hard experience of the past year,
and with the prospect of another campaign full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
as hard, that a brief furlough was what I needed,
so I could but try for one, which I did, and on
Sunday the 26th of the same month, received a
furlough for twenty days.</p>

<p>We had been paid off the day previous,
and it did not take me long to prepare for the
homeward trip. I said goodbye to my comrades
and left for City Point that afternoon. None of
the precious time must be wasted, so I made no
stops on my journey home.</p>

<p>I left City Point on the morning of the
27th, on the steamer Daniel Webster, arriving at
Fortress Munroe at four P. M., and an hour later
left for Baltimore, arriving there at seven o’clock
next morning; immediately left for New York,
which place I reached at six o’clock that evening
and took the train for home; traveled all night,
and arrived at New Bedford on the morning of
March 1st, where I was warmly welcomed by my
friends.</p>

<p>Oh how pleasant seemed the dear old
quiet city, after the terrible experience of the
year that is past! And how quickly passed the
time away! I paid a visit to my brother, now
living in New Hampshire, and had a very enjoyable
time. I spent the remainder of my time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
at home with my father, and among my friends,
who could hardly do enough to make the time
pass happily away.</p>

<p>Then too, I found that in the north, a soldier
seemed to be considered of some account,
and often strangers as they passed me in the
street, had a pleasant word for the war-worn soldier
in his faded suit of army blue.</p>

<p>All too soon the time arrived when I
must bid my friends goodbye. On the 16th of
March I started for the front once more. I cannot
dwell on the parting with my poor old father
who seemed to feel that he would never see me
again. But he was spared to welcome me home
after the war was over, for which I still feel very
thankful. It would have been a sad home-coming
had he not been there to welcome me.</p>

<p>On my arrival in Boston, as I had a few
hours to wait, I went to the State house to take
a look at our old battle-flag. What memories
were awakened by that torn and smoky piece of
silk, all that was left of the starry flag that I had
followed for two long years. I felt sad at parting,
“It might be for years, and it might be forever,”
and it was not a very cheerful journey back
to the front. I reached my regiment on the 19th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of March, and received a warm welcome from
the boys of my company, and especially from my
tentmate, Dwight Graves, who prepared a good
supper of fried hardtack and pork in honor of
my arrival, and to which he, at least, did ample
justice.</p>

<p>I presented him with a piece of frosted
cake, sent him by a lady friend, which he considered
a rare treat, and persisted in calling
“Wedding cake!” It took me several days to
settle down to army life, and army diet, but the
stern discipline and hard service soon brought
back my appetite, and my readiness to do whatever
was required of me.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock in the morning of the
25th, we were ordered to fall in and move to the
right, for the enemy had attacked us in that
quarter; then moved to the left and attacked
them; hard fighting continued all day, without
food or rest. This fight was called the battle of
Fort Stedman.</p>

<p>We returned to camp about midnight,
where we remained until the 29th, when we
broke camp early in the morning, and marched
until noon. We stopped two hours for dinner
and rest, then started again, and went until five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
P. M. Here we had another encounter with the
enemy, and drove them some distance. We then
moved to the front, and built works until midnight,
and laid behind them until morning, when
we again moved onward. I little thought as I
slung my equipments and started on the march,
that this was to be my last day of active service.</p>

WOUNDED.</h2>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>L. M. J.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Our line of march led us in the direction
of the Boydton plank road, and on the morning
of March 30th the 32nd was detailed for the skirmish
line. It was a rainy day, but we soldiers
could not stop for the weather. About two
o’clock in the afternoon, we sighted the enemy’s
pickets, and then firing began in earnest. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
went well with me until about three o’clock, when
I felt something strike my foot, not realizing
that it was a bullet until I saw the jagged holes
where it went in and out, breaking the bones as
it went.</p>

<p>I stood and considered a moment whether
to go to the rear or not, and finally decided to go
back, get the surgeon to dress my wound, and
then return to my company. It was quite a distance
back to the rear, and I had to drop my gun
and sit down to rest by the way. As I did so, I
saw my colonel, who stopped and asked me if I
was much hurt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Oh no,” I replied, “Only slight, I will soon
be back.”</p>

<p>“I am glad it is no worse,” he replied, and on
he went.</p>
</div>

<p>I found the surgeon, had my foot bound
up, and started to go back to my company.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where are you going?” asked the surgeon.</p>

<p>“Back to my company,” said I.</p>

<p>“No you’re not! Get on to that stretcher!”
was the order, and I was obliged to obey, though
I did not see the need of it; my foot did not pain
me, only felt numb, and I felt a little weak and
tired, which could hardly be wondered at. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
carried to the ambulance and taken to the field
hospital, where I sat and waited for my turn to
come. Meanwhile I saw such horrible wounds,
that I can never forget or describe. It was a
hard trial, for I was waiting for my turn to be
operated upon, not knowing whether I would lose
my foot or not.</p>
</div>

<p>My turn came at last, and I was given
chloroform, and knew nothing more until I was
being carried from the operating table to the
hospital tent, when the rain beating on my face
brought back my scattered senses.</p>

<p>Next morning the wounded were put on
board box cars, and sent to City Point, arriving
there late in the afternoon. Here I thought my
journey was at an end, but I was mistaken once
more.</p>

<p>The next morning the surgeon made his
rounds at eight o’clock, and all the badly wounded
were given a card, to show that they must be
sent on board the steamer which was to start for
Washington in an hour. I was pleased that I
received no card, as it showed that I was not
considered a bad case. At quarter to nine, the
assistant surgeon came in.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What sergeant, not on board yet?” Said he.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“No, I’m not going,” I answered.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that!” he replied, and out he
went. In a moment back he came with two men,
who bundled me onto a stretcher and carried me
on board the steamer just as she was to leave the
dock.</p>
</div>

<p>We arrived in Washington on the morning
of April 2nd and I was carried to Armory
Square hospital, where I was bathed and put to
bed. The lady nurse, a Miss Dixon of Connecticut,
came with an orange and a glass of lemonade,
but I could only shake my head in refusal,
for I was in too much pain to speak. My foot
had at last come to its feeling, and for the next
twenty-four hours I suffered the most excruciating
agony. I was given morphine, but it seemed
to have no effect for a while.</p>

<p>The surgeons thought my foot would have
to be taken off, but I begged them not to cripple
me for life and they postponed the operation for
a day. At their next visit, they decided the foot
could be saved, and I was very thankful. I suffered
a great deal after that, but my foot greatly
improved, until finally on the 19th of April, I
was allowed to get up, and managed to hobble on
crutches down to ward I, to visit sergeant Buker.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Was up a few hours, then went to bed very tired
and did not get up next day.</p>

<p>After that I was up every day, and soon
was able to get round very well on crutches. I
saw many sad sights during my stay in this hospital.
Many a poor fellow gave up the weary
struggle for life and died; one or two a day in my
ward alone for some time. We were treated very
kindly, and received good care and nursing.</p>

<p>Many citizens visited the hospitals, and
showed much sympathy for the sick and wounded
veterans. There was an old colored woman who
came daily with a big basket of pies, cakes, biscuits,
and other good things, and her coming was
always hailed with delight, for to those who were
able to eat what she brought she gave liberally,
and to those who could not, by order of the surgeons
receive them, she gave kind cheering words
promising to bring them something they could
eat the next time she came.</p>

<p>I do not remember her name, only that
we all called her “Aunty,” and that her mistress
allowed her to use all the time and material she
desired to make these dainties for the sick men,
who daily watched for her coming, and enjoyed
the good things she brought. I can testify to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the fact that she was a good cook, and I shall
ever remember her with gratitude. The lady
nurses who cared so tenderly for the sick and
wounded soldiers, will ever be kindly remembered
by me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile stirring events were taking
place. Lee’s surrender, which ended the fighting,
and the assassination of President Lincoln
occurred while I lay helpless in the hospital.
How I longed to be up and about, to help finish
the work in which I had been so long engaged.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Lee, and the succeeding
events, the army was massed around
Washington, my regiment with the rest, and my
tentmate Graves, and several other comrades
came to see me, and it was from them that I
learned what took place after I was wounded.</p>

<p>I can give the further movements of my
regiment after I was wounded, only from what
I learned later from my comrades, for to my
great regret, I was not with them to the end.
The Fifth corps kept on in spite of the enemy’s
artillery, until they reached around the extreme
right of the confederate line of works in front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Petersburg. Next day they were relieved by the
Second corps, and moved off again to the left, a
little to the west of the Boydton road. Here they
were attacked, and driven back, but again advanced
and drove the rebels back.</p>

<p>Four companies of our regiment were in
the line of skirmishers, and seized the opportunity
to get in the rear of the rebel skirmishers,
who were so surprised that they hastily retreated
leaving their dinner and stacked arms, all of
which were confiscated by the boys of the 32nd.
We were now on the extreme left of our army
and towards night our brigade was sent out to
find, and if possible to re-enforce General Sheridan.
We had all we could attend to in driving
the enemy out of our way, and it was morning
before we reached Sheridan.</p>

<p>That day, April 1st, was fought the battle
of Five Forks by the Fifth corps and the cavalry,
all under the command of the dashing and dauntless
Phil Sheridan. It was a complete victory
for our side, and we captured five thousand prisoners.</p>

<p>Next day, by order of General Sheridan,
General Warren was relieved of the command of
the Fifth corps, and our brigade commander,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
General Griffin took his place. The colonel of
our regiment, James A. Cunningham was placed
in command of a brigade of skirmishers, and
Ambrose Bancroft, captain of our company, (B,)
was placed in command of the 32nd, which was
included in Cunningham’s brigade.</p>

<p>Next day we were deployed to the west,
and reaching the South Side railroad, captured a
train of sick and wounded soldiers, took many
other prisoners, and a great quantity of stores
and supplies. Here we learned that General Lee
was leaving Petersburg, and retreating southward,
and General Sheridan hastened with his cavalry
and the Fifth corps to cut off his retreat.</p>

<p>On the 4th of April we seized the only
railroad by which Lee could escape, and on Sunday,
the 9th, he made a final attempt to cut his
way through our cavalry’s lines. Our brigade
had marched all day and half the night, and enjoyed
about two hours rest, when we were called
upon to re-enforce the cavalry.</p>

<p>Away we went, the 32nd leading the
column, the men gay and bright, and their guns
glistening in the sunshine. At the sight of our
coming the enemy retreated; they had no desire
to encounter the “Fighting Fifth” that day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Soon we received the order “Forward.” We advanced
under a sharp fire from their artillery,
and their front line fell back from our attack.
Just then General Lee sent one of his staff with
a flag of truce, and all hostilities ceased.</p>

<p>We soon heard that General Grant and
General Lee were holding a conference, and at
four P. M. the general orders announced that
Lee had surrendered. How profound was our
emotion when we realized that the war was at an
end!</p>

<p>The following day the two armies were
mingled together like old friends. The brave
confederates were entirely destitute of rations,
and we shared ours with the half starved men,
who had fought so long and so desperately for a
cause that was lost. The next day was the formal
surrender of arms. Our brigade received
the surrender, and the 32nd was on the right of
the line. Drawn up in line of battle, guns at
shoulder, loaded and capped, eyes front, no cheering,
no jeering, only a sympathetic silence, while
the gallant but defeated foe advanced in front
the length of our line, then faced us, stacked
arms, laid colors and equipments on stack, then
marched away to make room for another line,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
until all had given up their arms. It was a
thrilling sight, never to be forgotten by those
who witnessed it.</p>

<p>After the surrender the regiment was
kept busy in various ways, but at last started for
Washington in time to take part in the grand
review, which occurred on the 23rd and 24th of
May, 1865. I could not march with my comrades,
but witnessed the parade from a stand reserved
for disabled veterans. In those two days,
150 000 men marched up Pennsylvania Avenue
from the Capitol, by the White House, out to
Georgetown, and across the Potomac river into
Virginia once more.</p>

<p>What a sight it was! I cannot describe
my feelings as I saw those columns of veterans
march by, knowing so well what they had endured,
and what they had accomplished. I was
proud to call them comrades. Nor did I forget
the many thousands of brave men who died that
their country might live. I thought sadly of my
companions in arms, whose faces I missed when
my regiment passed by; they will never be forgotten
until I too have joined the grand army of
the dead.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Eugene H. Munday.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I remained in Armory Square hospital until
the 26th of May, when I was transferred to a
place called White Hall, on the Delaware river,
about eighteen miles above Philadelphia. It was
formally a seminary, but had been taken for
hospital use. At the time I wished it had always
remained what it was built for, as it was the
most lonesome and dreary place I ever saw. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
nearest place was a village called Bristol, two
miles away, and we went there when we could,
and those who were able traveled the country for
miles around, just to pass the time away. It
seemed very hard, now that the war was over,
and our services no longer needed, that we could
not return to our homes.</p>

<p>On the 7th of June they began mustering
out men of the different states, and fifty to a
hundred men left the hospital for home every
day. Day after day passed, and there still remained
all those of my regiment, six or seven,
with no sign of being mustered out.</p>

<p>On the 3rd day of July we heard of our
regiment passing through Philadelphia on its way
home, and then we could content ourselves no
longer. We wanted to be with them when they
entered old Massachusetts again, and to be with
our comrades once more before the regiment was
disbanded, and those who had been our companions
so long were scattered far and wide.</p>

<p>We went to the surgeon in charge, and
asked him why we were not discharged.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It takes a long while to get your descriptive
lists from the front, and I intend to have you
veterans discharged for wounds received in action,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
and you would get a hundred dollars extra,”
was his reply.</p>
</div>

<p>But that was no inducement to me to stay
there any longer, and I asked him if I could not
be sent to my regiment, and he gave his consent,
so on the 6th of July, in company with one
or two others of my regiment, I bade goodbye
to my hospital life, and started for Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Arriving in Boston on the evening of
the 7th, we remained there that night and the
next morning took the steamer for Galloupe’s
Island, where our regiment was quartered.</p>

<p>Here we remained until the thirteenth,
when the regiment was disbanded, and the boys
left for their homes. The 32nd was no more,
but their deeds will never die.</p>

<p>I went back to Boston to wait for my discharge,
made a brief visit home to spend Sunday
and returned to Boston, where on the 18th of
July 1865, I received my discharge, and was
a free man once more, having served Uncle
Sam for three years, eight months and sixteen
days. I was with my company from the
time I enlisted until I was wounded, with the exception
of two furloughs. My wound was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
healed, though I had to use a cane for some
time longer.</p>

<p>When I enlisted, my mind was made up
to do my duty, whatever the consequences, and I
trust it will not seem like boasting when I say
that I did so every time. When traitors tried to
destroy the best government that ever existed,
and dishonor their country’s flag, I felt if was
my duty to enlist and do what I could for my
native land, and I have never been sorry that I
did so.</p>

<p>My health was always good, and I was
fortunate in battle, never being laid off duty until
I was wounded, just before the last battle in
which my regiment participated. In thirty-eight
battles, I shared the dangers with my comrades
of company B. But where are the 101 men of
my company who left Concord for Fort Warren
on that cold morning of December 3rd, 1861?
I called the roll of company B in 1865, when
there were but eight men left of the original
company.</p>

<p>Ah, the memories that arise of the brave
boys who shared with me the hardships and dangers
of those long years of warfare! Brothers
could not be dearer than those who have shared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
their last hardtack with me, helped me off the
field when wounded, cheered me on the long and
tiresome march when I was about ready to give
up and drop by the wayside. I think I used to
dread the long marches more than I did the battles,
and welcome the sight of a brush with the
enemy that would stop the march for a while.</p>

<p>We had each to carry a musket, 40 to 80
rounds of ammunition, haversack with four to six
days rations, knapsack, blanket, shelter tent, together
with our canteen and other small articles
that we could not do without, and to carry this
on the march from ten to twenty hours at a time
with only a few moments now and then to rest,
often seemed more of a trial to me than the hardest
fought battle I was ever in.</p>

<p>But the hardest trial of all was to have
my comrades shot down on my right and on my
left, and have to rush on with the rest in the
charge, or in battle, leaving them behind to suffer
and die.</p>

<p>No words can do justice to that experience,
or the feeling of the battle-worn soldier,
when he starts out after the battle is over to hunt
up his comrades that have not answered the rollcall,
will never answer it again, and he digs a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
hole in the ground with his bayonet and wrapping
a blanket around his dead comrade’s body,
lays him to rest in an unknown grave forevermore.</p>

<p>And now my story is told; it is a plain,
true tale of my experience in the War of the
Rebellion, and may help the future generations
to understand just what their fathers suffered,
that their native land might remain forever, an
undivided nation.</p>
